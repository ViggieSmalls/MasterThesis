    "This is short overview of undiscussed topics in the Master's Thesis. It covers some theoretical background on following topics:\n",

    "1. **Structural/Shot noise**: How to measure the SNR and SSNR\n",
    "2. **Radiation damage**: Calculation\n",

    "## 1. Noise\n",
    "The **true SNR** of an image can only be determined from simulated data. If the variance of the signal and noise are known, and the signal and noise are both zero-mean, SNR can be:\n",

    "\n",
    "This can be done in two ways: either from a micrograph fully exposed to an electron dose of 3900 e/A² and no radiation damage, or by averaging a simulated frame stack with radiation damage. The results are:\n",

    "There are two methods to calculate the SNR:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1**:\n",
    "$var ( \\overline p_{[N]} )$ is the variance of the average image, $var(p)$ is the variance of the signal, $var(n)$ is the variance of the noise.\n",

    "#### 1.1.1 Shot noise\n",
    "The amount of noise that is being contributed by shot noise can be determined by comparing two micrographs of the same imaging field. Since I did not have two successive micrographs of the same imaging field, I decided to make the calculations on a frame stack of 22 aligned frames. Method 1 gives the SNR of a single frame as output, Method 2 can be used both on caomparing two single frames as well as the average of frames, e.g. odd vs. even.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also decided to compute the SNR of simulated images the same way as for the real images, for comparison. The images were simulated without structural noise, so the only noise source is shot noise. Radiation damage was taken into account. \n",

    "#### 1.1.2 Structural noise\n",
    "The structural noise has both a constant and a variable component throughout a movie stack. The constant component comes with the amorphous structure of the ice and structural variations of the protein, the variable component can be reffered to as the effect of brownian motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant component can clearly be seen in the power spectra of the movie stacks. While thon rings are not visible in single frames, they appear in the average of aligned frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of structural noise can be determined by comparing particles with the same orientation. In this case, using the first method for calculating the SNR is more appropiate. Also, using a mask for the calculation of the SNR would improve the estimation of the SNR of the particle alone. But one must not forget that the particle is embeded in ice. So one could also estimate the SNR of amorphous ice, calculate the ice thickness and estimate the SNR of the particle alone. Well, this would not be that easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple way to do this would be to just calculate the SNR of a single particle of an aligned movie stack by the first method. This SNR is the result of shot noise and all other noise sources like radiation damage, particle motion, structural variation etc., refered to as structural noise. Assuming the determined SNR is denoted as $\\alpha_{comp\\_struct}$ and the SNR related to the shot noise is $\\alpha_{exp}$, then the value of the true structural SNR $\\alpha_{true\\_struct}$, untangled from the shot noise, is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\alpha_{true\\_struct} = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{(1+1/\\alpha_{comp\\_struct})}{ (1+1/\\alpha_{exp})} - 1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "So the true structural SNR $\\alpha_{true\\_struct}$ should be the value achieved for a simulated image without the addition of shot noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\alpha_{true\\_struct} = \\frac{var(signal)}{var(struct\\_noise)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Ice thickness variations \n",
    "One must also consider the effect of low frequency noise on the accuracy of the alignment. Ice is generally not equally flat everywhere on the sample, so local variations influence the densities. Though such an effect is fairly easy to add to the simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 SSNR\n",
    "The spectral signal to noise ratio can be determined by following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "SSNR(r) = \\frac{ FSC(r) }{ 1 - FSC(r) }\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "The three-dimensional Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) was introduced by Harauz and van Heel in 1986.

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "### 2.2 Limitations\n",
    "The parameters for the exposure filter are only determined for the Rotavirus at 300 kV. Different proteins and different voltage would give different critical exposures. Some structural features are more sensitive to radiation damage than others. For example carboxyl groups are highly affected by radiation damage, while aromatic groups are less sensitive. Also secondary structure features like the $\\alpha$-helix backbone are very resistant to radiation damage. Measurements of critical exposure are also affected by alignment accuracy of the particles, which in turn is influenced by beam induced movement and rotation.\n",
